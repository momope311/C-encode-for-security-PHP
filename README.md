# Critical Data Encoding for PHP in C

## Overview

Protecting sensitive data—such as passwords, usernames, and database credentials—can be challenging. This package provides a C-based encoder for Linux and Windows, allowing you to securely encode critical information for use in PHP applications. By encoding your data locally, this package helps prevent sensitive information from being stored in plain text on your server.

## How It Works

1. **Encode Locally**: Run the encoder on your local machine to encode the required data (e.g., passwords, access keys). You’ll receive a hexadecimal notation and a shift value.
2. **Decode in PHP**: Use the provided PHP decoder to decode the data within your PHP project, allowing you to access the original information without storing it in plain text.

This process minimizes security risks by ensuring that your critical data is stored locally and not in its original form on the server.

## Challenge

The program contains several layers of encoding, converting and moving symbols and characters, so the reversible process is very complicated.

## Package Contents

- **Linux Encoder**: `linux/encode`
- **Windows Encoder**: `windows/encode.exe`
- **PHP Decoder**: `php/decode.php`

Keep the encoders on your local machine and include the decoder in your PHP project.

## Installation and Usage

1. Run the encoder to generate encoded data for your critical information.
2. Include `php/decode.php` in your PHP project to decode and retrieve the original values as needed.

## Note

While no method provides absolute security, this approach significantly enhances data protection for locally stored critical data.
